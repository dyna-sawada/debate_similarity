“Homework should be abolished”
“free time”
(“decrease burden on teachers”)
(We believe that) if homework were to be abolished,
we could have more free time
(As a result,) we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends
In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework
(As a result,) I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time
It is not healthy


[LO1]
(They said that) By abolishing homework, we will have more free time
(However,) their situation was like, they don't have enough free time because of their large amount of homework
(So) we can get more free time just by reducing the amount of our homework
(Even if) we have a lot of homework, 
we can make time by doing it efficiently
(For example,) I have extra class after school, so I do my homework at school during the brake time. By doing like this, l get 8 hours' sleep every day
That means that homework doesn't affect our sleep time


[LO2]
(They said that) in order to get more free time and reduce the pressure of teachers, homework should be abolished
(However, I don't think so, because) homework is a kind of review and feedback for students who have learned knowledge on the same day, 
to deepen their impression of knowledge, students can enter their ideal university and learn knowledge is inseparable, 
but there are many students in many countries in the world whose homework is beyond their scope, 
they don't have time to participate other activities
So I don't think homework should be abolished, but we can reduce the amount of homework properly and let students have more free time so that the burden of teachers can also be reduced


[LO3]
(They said that) homework steals our time and we cannot have enough free time to do something we like
(For example, club activity, hobbies, and playing. In addition, some students have to go to cram school. If we try to do everything like playing, taking lesson, and homework in a day, we end up going to bed later. Lack of sleep have a bad influence for our mind and body. For that reason as their first point, they claim that homework should be abolished.)
(However,) the most important work for students is study 
What we learn at school is very significant and we often apply that knowledge to our favorite things to do
(In addition,) making a habit of studying at home is also important 
(It is true that) we are very busy and homework is burden to us,
(but having a different viewpoint) it is a chance to acquire the way of time management
We should make use of small pocket of time


[*LO4*]
(They said that) they go to a club activity everyday to do a great performance
(I think) this is a good thing
(Also,) they can get their knowledge at their cram school
(However,) only a few of them can gain money through the activity
Sports players or trainers need to have money, sense and force
Others have to gain knowledge for whole life earning
To work at office need what is taught in classes
Most students can’t gain enough knowledge only in their classes
Their class time is limited and teachers can’t confirm whether all students understood or not
Teachers can confirm through their homework


[LO5]
(They said that) if homework were to be abolished, they could do more what they really wanted
Certainly, such activities are important and enrich their life
(However,) they may not always acquire something useful in their life from such activities
If what they really want to do is such a "less useful activity",
they should do it current free time, for example after finishing their homework. 
(Moreover,) being aware that "when they finish their homework, they can do what they want to do",
they can concentrate on their homework to finish it quickly
That is, they can study efficiently


[LO6]
(They said that) the students have no free time
(However,) you can play tennis
Is that time to enjoy what you like?
If you have another you want to do, you need to chose which you do <Uncertainly>
Studying is duty for the students so you must study, not only doing you like
(Also) you can study for more than five hours thanks to homework. 
Certainly, teachers have to think how much to give the students homework 
but you need to think how to use your own time
If I was in your case, I would divised the ways to study effective <Uncertainly>
I use things to learn in cram school when I do homework
The more you think how to study effective by yourself, the more you will improve your thinking ability
This ability is useful for you in the future, for example when you have to study for universary admission
(So) homework can't be the reason you can't have time.


[LO7]
(They said that) more free time is necessary for students who go to club activity and cram school
(However,) if you want more free time,
you should just reduce time for club and cram school
Time for homework is important as well as for club and cram school
It would be great 
if you could keep a good work-study-leisure balance
(But,) if you must sleep,
maybe you should get up early and study in the morning
You can clear your head and increase efficiency of study in the morning


[LO8]
(They said that) homework should be abolished 
(because) they can't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time
(However, I think) club activities, hobbies, and playing with friends are necessary, 
(but I also think that) being able to plan ahead and be able to do homework is also a necessary ability
Rather than waiting for you to have some free time, you can improve your ability to manage time later in life by creating it yourself 
So I think homework which I can manage and do should not be abolished


[LO9]
(They said that) if homework were to be abolished, they could have more free time 
(As a result,) they could do more of what they really wanted
(However,) time can be spared
(We believe) if students have time to do club activities or hobbies, 
they also need to spend some time on homework
We do not oppose club activities or hobbies 
(However, we believe that) as a student, time should be spent on homework
We do not think every student has enough self-discipline
(So) they are obligated to do homework
We can not alway have free time
For their better future, people should do some thing they do not want to


[LO10]
(They said that) they have two merits by abolishing homework
First, they could use more free time
Second, their teachers could decrease using their time to check and prepare homework
(However, I have three points for this idea.)
First, students will be more fool
(because) their time to study is decreasing
(It is common sense)
Second, students will forget learning contents soon 
(because) they can't review them
They can keep learning contents in mind by doing their homework and reviewing what they have learned
Third, students can have more studying time by doing their homework
In recent years, it is said that the study time is insufficient
