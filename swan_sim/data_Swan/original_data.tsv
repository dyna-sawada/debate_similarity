"1"	"HW1_pm"	"Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. 
We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. 
Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you."	"1"

They said, students will have more free time by abolishing homework. However, what students will do during free time is just playing games and chatting using SNS in most cases or just sleeping as they said. It is because human is lazy in nature. Doing hard thing is usually difficult. Then, many students will not study at home. Of course, some students maybe study what they want to learn, however, the problem is for those kids who can’t study by themselves. Imagine, elementary school students, they don’t know what study is important and how to do that. Then, some instructions such as homework is very important. Some of you may think homework is worthless, but giving homework meaning giving the opportunity to study is much more meaningful than do nothing or doing addictive games. That's why free time by abolishing homework is rather harmful to students.

They said that homework steals our time and we cannot have enough free time to do something we like. For example, club activity, hobbies, and playing. In addition, some students have to go to cram school. If we try to do everything like playing, taking lesson, and homework in a day, we end up going to bed later. Lack of sleep have a bad influence for our mind and body. For that reason as their first point, they claim that homework should be abolished. However, the most important work for students is study. What we learn at school is very significant and we often apply that knowledge to our favorite things to do. In addition, making a habit of studying at home is also important. It is true that we are very busy and homework is burden to us, but having a different viewpoint it is a chance to acquire the way of time management. We should make use of small pocket of time.

They said that By abolishing homework, we will have more freetime. However, their situation was like, they don't have enough free time because of their large amout of homework. So we can get more free time just by reducing the amount of our homework. Even if we have a lot of homework, we can make time by doing it efficiently. For example, I have extra class after school, so I do my homework at school during the brake time. By doing like this, I get 8 hours' sleep every day. That means that homework doesn't affect our sleep time. Therefore we don't have to abolish homework.

However, they may not always aquire something useful in their life from such activities. If what they really want to do is such a ""less useful activity"", they should do it current free time, for example after finishing their homework. Moreover, being aware that ""when they finish thier homework, they can do what they want to do"", they can concentrate on their homework to finish it quickly. That is, they can study efficiently.

They said that more free time is necessary for students who go to club activity and cram school. However, if you want more free time,  you should just reduce time for club and cram school. Time for homework is important as well as for club and cram school. It would be great if you could keep a good work-study-leisure balance. But, if you must sleep, maybe you should get up early and study in the morning. You can clear your head and increase efficiency of study in the morning.

They said that they go to a club activity everyday to do a great performance. I think this is a good thing. Also, they can get their knowledge at their cram school. However, only a few of them can gain money through the activity. Sports players or trainers need to have money, sense and force. Others have to gain knowledge for whole life earning. To work at office need what is taught in classes. Most students can’t gain enough knowledge only in their classes. Their class time is limited and teachers can’t confirm whether  all students understood or not. Teachers can confirm through their homework.

They said that the students have no free time. However, you can play tennis. Is that time to enjoy what you like? If you have another you want to do, you need to chose which you do. Studying is duty for the students so you must study, not only doing you like. Also you can study for more than five hours  thanks to homework. Certainly, teachers have to think how much to give the students homework but you need to think how to use your own time. If i was in your case, I would adivise the ways to study effective. I use things to learn in cram school when I do homework. The more you think how to study effective by yourself, the more you will improve your thinking ability. This ability is useful for you in the future, for example when you have to study for universally admission. So homework can't be the reason you can't have time.

They said that, if homework were to be abolished, they could have more free time. As a result, they could do more of what they really wanted. However, time can be spared.  We believe if students have time to do club activities or hobbies, they also need to spend some time on homework. We do not oppose club activities or hobbies. However, we believe that as a student, time should be spent on homework. We do not think every student has enough self-discipline. So they are obligated to do homework. We can not alway have free time. For their better future, people should do some thing they do not want to.

They said that, they have two merits by abolishing homework. First, they could use more free time. Second, their teachers could decrease using their time to check and prepare homework. However, I have three points for this idea. First, students will be more fool because their time to study is decreasing. It is common sense. Second, students will forget learning contents soon because they can't review them. They can keep learning contents in mind by doing their homework and reviewing what they have learned. Third,  students can have more studying time by doing their homework. In recent years, it is said that the study time is insufficient.

They said that, if we can have more free time, we can do more of what we really want. However, ""all students cannot do a worthy activity for themselves. Some do more of what we really want, others waste time on doing nothing or playing video games. So it is necessary for us to do homework not to waste time. we think doing homework make a habit for healthy life.  ""Heavy"" homework makes us unhealthy life, but ""homework"" is not. We surely need to think the amount of homework, but it is not reason for unnecessary homework.

They said that, If we don’t have homework, we have more free time and more healthy day. And teacher’s burden will be decreased. However, a number of people who don’t study at all will increase. People are forgetful, so not doing homework leads to insufficient fixing of class contents of the day. Thus during a week immediately before a semester test people who don’t do class reviews will be more busy and then, they will fail in the examination for lack of preparation. To decrease a number of people who repeat years, homework is necessary.

In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, they cannot take sleep time because of a lot of homework, so it is not healthy. However, the most important thing in this problem is not the existence of homework but the amount of that. They said that a lot of homework results going to bed late at night. Then, if they have a little homework, they can solve this problem. In addition, if homework is abolished, when does PM study? If they spend free time that abolishing homework cause on sleeping, they do not study at all. So, there is no need to abolish homework.

They said that, in order to let students have more free time and reduce the burden of teachers, homework should be abolished. However, After the abolition of homework, students can't get a good review of the knowledge they learn in school, and for students who don't have the habit of reviewing after class, the abolition of homework is a very bad thing for them. This has no good effect on their entrance examination in the future, and it is OK to reduce homework properly, but abolishing homework can not be said to lighten the burden on teachers.

They said that, if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. However, It is easily conceivable that some people are just playing with their friends in their free time without studying at all. Therefore, there will be a big difference in academic ability depending on whether or not you study in your free time. As a result, there are many people who are unable to get the desired profession or who cannot go on to higher education due to lack of academic ability.

They said that, if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. In other words, we can not do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends because of a lot of homework. However, I think that we have enough time for doing more of what we really like. We can play with friends and devote oneself to club activities and hobbies on weekend like Saturday and Sunday. If we don't have enough time on weekend, we should consider our ways to spend time. In this case, we don't have enough time on weekday. So, we have to consider our ways to spend time more effectively.

They said that, homework should be abolished because  they can't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. However, I think club activities, hobbies, and playing with friends are necessary, but I also think that being able to plan ahead and be able to do homework is also a necessary ability.
Rather than waiting for you to have some free time, you can improve your ability to manage time later in life by creating it yourself. So I think homework which I can manage and do should not be abolished.

They said that, Homework robs us of our free time. However, Students have holidays and two long vacations in a year. They are enough time to do our hobbies or play friends. We can go trip in a vacation and play friends in holidays. Also, We can talk with friends at break time in school. And besides, We may not have such a lot of homework and cram school everyday. Students have a lot of free time than you think. At least, they have more free time than adults.

They said that, homework should be abolished, because They don't have the time to do what they want. However, They insist that they want free time, but it is themselves who decide to do club activities. It's funny to argue that I don't have time to do my homework because of that. Also, the purpose of going to a cram school is to make up for what is lacking in class. It's funny that I can't do my homework as part of the class because of that. If you want to continue club activities and cram school, your homework should be done properly.

クラブ活動等をしたければ、宿題は適切にせねばならないという主張は伝わりました。

They said that, by eliminating homework, students gain free time, which allows them to do what they really want. However, the elimination of homework could reduce the number of students who are actively engaged in the study itself. Homework is compulsory, so it is an important opportunity for students who are not independent about their studies to study at home. Also, it is said that you cannot do what you like because of your homework, but if you proceed in a planned manner, it will not be a big burden.

They said that, they could do more what they really wanted, if homework were to be abolished. However, students would lose the opportunities when they have to do what they don’t like in their school-days, if school abolished homework. For example , when they get their first job, they often have to do what they don’t want. If they couldn’t put up with it and continue to do it, they would be thrown out of employment and it would be difficult for them to live in society.
