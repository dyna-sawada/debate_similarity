            "content": "Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you."

            "content": "They said that By abolishing homework, we will have more freetime. However, their situation was like, they don't have enough free time because of their large amout of homework. So we can get more free time just by reducing the amount of our homework. Even if we have a lot of homework, we can make time by doing it efficiently. For example, I have extra class after school, so I do my homework at school during the brake time. By doing like this, I get 8 hours' sleep every day. That means that homework doesn't affect our sleep time. Therefore we don't have to abolish homework."

            "content": "They said, students will have more free time by abolishing homework. However, what students will do during free time is just playing games and chatting using SNS in most cases or just sleeping as they said. It is because human is lazy in nature. Doing hard thing is usually difficult. Then, many students will not study at home. Of course, some students maybe study what they want to learn, however, the problem is for those kids who can’t study by themselves. Imagine, elementary school students, they don’t know what study is important and how to do that. Then, some instructions such as homework is very important. Some of you may think homework is worthless, but giving homework meaning giving the opportunity to study is much more meaningful than do nothing or doing addictive games. That's why free time by abolishing homework is rather harmful to students."

        "LO1-4": {
            "content": "They said that homework steals our time and we cannot have enough free time to do something we like. For example, club activity, hobbies, and playing. In addition, some students have to go to cram school. If we try to do everything like playing, taking lesson, and homework in a day, we end up going to bed later. Lack of sleep have a bad influence for our mind and body. For that reason as their first point, they claim that homework should be abolished. However, the most important work for students is study. What we learn at school is very significant and we often apply that knowledge to our favorite things to do. In addition, making a habit of studying at home is also important. It is true that we are very busy and homework is burden to us, but having a different viewpoint it is a chance to acquire the way of time management. We should make use of small pocket of time."

            "content": "They said that if homework were to be abolished, they could do more what they really wanted. Certainly, such activities are important and enrich their life. However, they may not always aquire something useful in their life from such activities. If what they really want to do is such a 'less useful activity', they should do it current free time, for example after finishing their homework. Moreover, being aware that 'when they finish thier homework, they can do what they want to do', they can concentrate on their homework to finish it quickly. That is, they can study efficiently."

However, I don't think so, because homework is a kind of review and feedback for students who have learned knowledge on the same day, to deepen their impression of knowledge, students can enter their ideal university and learn knowledge is inseparable, but there are many students in many countries in the world whose homework is beyond their scope, they don't have time to participate other activities. So I don't think homework should be abolished, but we can reduce the amount of homework properly and let students have more free time so that the burden of teachers can also be reduced."

            "content": "They said that more free time is necessary for students who go to club activity and cram school. However, if you want more free time,  you should just reduce time for club and cram school. Time for homework is important as well as for club and cram school. It would be great if you could keep a good work-study-leisure balance. But, if you must sleep, maybe you should get up early and study in the morning. You can clear your head and increase efficiency of study in the morning."

However, only a few of them can gain money through the activity. Sports players or trainers need to have money, sense and force. Others have to gain knowledge for whole life earning. To work at office need what is taught in classes. Most students can’t gain enough knowledge only in their classes. Their class time is limited and teachers can’t confirm whether  all students understood or not. Teachers can confirm through their homework."

If you have another you want to do, you need to chose which you do. Studying is duty for the students so you must study, not only doing you like. Also you can study for more than five hours  thanks to homework. Certainly, teachers have to think how much to give the students homework but you need to think how to use your own time. If i was in your case, I would adivise the ways to study effective. I use things to learn in cram school when I do homework. The more you think how to study effective by yourself, the more you will improve your thinking ability. This ability is useful for you in the future, for example when you have to study for universally admission. So homework can't be the reason you can't have time."

We believe if students have time to do club activities or hobbies, they also need to spend some time on homework. We do not oppose club activities or hobbies. However, we believe that as a student, time should be spent on homework. We do not think every student has enough self-discipline. So they are obligated to do homework. We can not alway have free time. For their better future, people should do some thing they do not want to."

Second, their teachers could decrease using their time to check and prepare homework. However, I have three points for this idea. First, students will be more fool because their time to study is decreasing. It is common sense. Second, students will forget learning contents soon because they can't review them. They can keep learning contents in mind by doing their homework and reviewing what they have learned. Third,  students can have more studying time by doing their homework. In recent years, it is said that the study time is insufficient."

Some do more of what we really want, others waste time on doing nothing or playing video games. So it is necessary for us to do homework not to waste time. we think doing homework make a habit for healthy life.  'Heavy' homework makes us unhealthy life, but 'homework' is not. We surely need to think the amount of homework, but it is not reason for unnecessary homework."

Then, if they have a little homework, they can solve this problem. In addition, if homework is abolished, when does PM study? If they spend free time that abolishing homework cause on sleeping, they do not study at all. So, there is no need to abolish homework."

So I think homework which I can manage and do should not be abolished."

This has no good effect on their entrance examination in the future, and it is OK to reduce homework properly, but abolishing homework can not be said to lighten the burden on teachers."

However, I think that we have enough time for doing more of what we really like. We can play with friends and devote oneself to club activities and hobbies on weekend like Saturday and Sunday. If we don't have enough time on weekend, we should consider our ways to spend time. In this case, we don't have enough time on weekday.

Also, the purpose of going to a cram school is to make up for what is lacking in class. It's funny that I can't do my homework as part of the class because of that.

Homework is compulsory, so it is an important opportunity for students who are not independent about their studies to study at home.

However, a number of people who don’t study at all will increase. People are forgetful, so not doing homework leads to insufficient fixing of class contents of the day. Thus during a week immediately before a semester test people who don’t do class reviews will be more busy and then, they will fail in the examination for lack of preparation.

In the end, the person can not achieve anything. They said that we have so much things to do and if we have to do homework on top of that, we do not have enough sleep. We all have 24 hours, and each one of us make choice what to do in that time. If the person is smart and wise, the person can make plan and do homework.

Students are very tired, so they tend to play or something in free time. for example, net surfing, playing video games, and so on.
