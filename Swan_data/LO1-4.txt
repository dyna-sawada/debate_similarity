Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that homework steals our time and we cannot have enough free time to do something we like. For example, club activity, hobbies, and playing. In addition, some students have to go to cram school. If we try to do everything like playing, taking lesson, and homework in a day, we end up going to bed later. Lack of sleep have a bad influence for our mind and body. For that reason as their first point, they claim that homework should be abolished. However, the most important work for students is study. What we learn at school is very significant and we often apply that knowledge to our favorite things to do. In addition, making a habit of studying at home is also important. It is true that we are very busy and homework is burden to us, but having a different viewpoint it is a chance to acquire the way of time management. We should make use of small pocket of time.
