Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, they cannot take sleep time because of a lot of homework, so it is not healthy. However, the most important thing in this problem is not the existence of homework but the amount of that. They said that a lot of homework results going to bed late at night. Then, if they have a little homework, they can solve this problem. In addition, if homework is abolished, when does PM study? If they spend free time that abolishing homework cause on sleeping, they do not study at all. So, there is no need to abolish homework.

もっとも重要なことは何か、と冒頭に述べることで、もっとも言いたいことを効果的に伝えていました。
PMでは寝る時間だけでなく、クラブ活動などの自由時間について
