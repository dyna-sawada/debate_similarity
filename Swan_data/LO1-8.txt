Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that more free time is necessary for students who go to club activity and cram school. However, if you want more free time,  you should just reduce time for club and cram school. Time for homework is important as well as for club and cram school. It would be great if you could keep a good work-study-leisure balance. But, if you must sleep, maybe you should get up early and study in the morning. You can clear your head and increase efficiency of study in the morning.
