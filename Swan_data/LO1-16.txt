Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. However, It is easily conceivable that some people are just playing with their friends in their free time without studying at all. Therefore, there will be a big difference in academic ability depending on whether or not you study in your free time. As a result, there are many people who are unable to get the desired profession or who cannot go on to higher education due to lack of academic ability.
