Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that the students have no free time. However, you can play tennis. Is that time to enjoy what you like? If you have another you want to do, you need to chose which you do. Studying is duty for the students so you must study, not only doing you like. Also you can study for more than five hours  thanks to homework. Certainly, teachers have to think how much to give the students homework but you need to think how to use your own time. If i was in your case, I would adivise the ways to study effective. I use things to learn in cram school when I do homework. The more you think how to study effective by yourself, the more you will improve your thinking ability. This ability is useful for you in the future, for example when you have to study for universally admission. So homework can't be the reason you can't have time.

どのように効果的に勉強するかを考えることで、思考力も身につくというアイデアは良かったです。また、思考力がいかに大事かにも触れていてよかったです。
「生徒にとって勉強は義務であるため勉強をしなければならない」とありましたが、勉強がなぜ重要か、またはいかに重要か、も補足説明できるとよりよいでしょう。
