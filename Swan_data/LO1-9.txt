Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, homework should be abolished because  they can't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. However, I think club activities, hobbies, and playing with friends are necessary, but I also think that being able to plan ahead and be able to do homework is also a necessary ability.
Rather than waiting for you to have some free time, you can improve your ability to manage time later in life by creating it yourself. So I think homework which I can manage and do should not be abolished.
