Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, Homework robs us of our free time. However, Students have holidays and two long vacations in a year. They are enough time to do our hobbies or play friends. We can go trip in a vacation and play friends in holidays. Also, We can talk with friends at break time in school. And besides, We may not have such a lot of homework and cram school everyday. Students have a lot of free time than you think. At least, they have more free time than adults.

自由時間がいかに多いかを丁寧に描写しているのがよかったです。
聴衆によって想像する宿題の量が異なりますので、たとえもっと宿題が多かったとしても相手の主張は成立しない、と2段階で反論できるとよりよいでしょう。
