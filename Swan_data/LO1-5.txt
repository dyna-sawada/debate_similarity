Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that they go to a club activity everyday to do a great performance. I think this is a good thing. Also, they can get their knowledge at their cram school. However, only a few of them can gain money through the activity. Sports players or trainers need to have money, sense and force. Others have to gain knowledge for whole life earning. To work at office need what is taught in classes. Most students can’t gain enough knowledge only in their classes. Their class time is limited and teachers can’t confirm whether  all students understood or not. Teachers can confirm through their homework.

教員が生徒の理解度を知るために宿題が必要というアイデアは良かったです。
スポーツ等での活動でお金を得ることが難しいことは伝わりましたが、そのことが今回の反論とどう結びつくのか、もう少し丁寧に説明できるとよいでしょう。
