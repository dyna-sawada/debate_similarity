Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, homework should be abolished, because They don't have the time to do what they want. However, They insist that they want free time, but it is themselves who decide to do club activities. It's funny to argue that I don't have time to do my homework because of that. Also, the purpose of going to a cram school is to make up for what is lacking in class. It's funny that I can't do my homework as part of the class because of that. If you want to continue club activities and cram school, your homework should be done properly.

クラブ活動等をしたければ、宿題は適切にせねばならないという主張は伝わりました。
PMは、クラブ活動等のために時間がなくて宿題ができない、と言っているのではなく、宿題があるため、クラブ活動などのやりたいことがあまりできないといっています。宿題にプライオリティを置いている主張のため、それを踏まえて反論しましょう。
