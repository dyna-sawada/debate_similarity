Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that By abolishing homework, we will have more freetime. However, their situation was like, they don't have enough free time because of their large amout of homework. So we can get more free time just by reducing the amount of our homework. Even if we have a lot of homework, we can make time by doing it efficiently. For example, I have extra class after school, so I do my homework at school during the brake time. By doing like this, I get 8 hours' sleep every day. That means that homework doesn't affect our sleep time. Therefore we don't have to abolish homework.

うまく時間を使うことで睡眠もとれるということを述べられたのはよかったです。＜代替案＞
