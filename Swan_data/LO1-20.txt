Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that, by eliminating homework, students gain free time, which allows them to do what they really want. However, the elimination of homework could reduce the number of students who are actively engaged in the study itself. Homework is compulsory, so it is an important opportunity for students who are not independent about their studies to study at home. Also, it is said that you cannot do what you like because of your homework, but if you proceed in a planned manner, it will not be a big burden.

生徒の性質として、自分で十分に家で勉強できるほどではない、という分析はよかったです。
計画的に宿題をすることについて、具体的に描写できるとよりよいでしょう。
