Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”. We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

They said that if homework were to be abolished, they could do more what they really wanted. Certainly, such activities are important and enrich their life. However, they may not always aquire something useful in their life from such activities. If what they really want to do is such a "less useful activity", they should do it current free time, for example after finishing their homework. Moreover, being aware that "when they finish thier homework, they can do what they want to do", they can concentrate on their homework to finish it quickly. That is, they can study efficiently.

自由時間を”less useful activity”に使っていると強調できているのがよかったです。＜強調ポイント＞
いかに”less useful activity”であるのか、説明できるとよりよいです。＜詳細な説明＞
